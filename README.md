Tasks app for ownCloud.

### Installation

 * **Using git:** In your `owncloud/apps/` directory, run `git clone https://github.com/owncloud/tasks/`. Then go to the Apps manager tab in your Owncloud web interface, and enable the Tasks app.
 * **Using the zip archive:** Download the latest [zip archive](https://github.com/owncloud/tasks/archive/master.zip), extract the `tasks-master` directory inside your `owncloud/apps/` directory, and rename it to `tasks`. For stable releases, you can also download one of the [releases](https://github.com/owncloud/tasks/releases) tar.gz archives. Then go to the Apps manager tab in your Owncloud web interface, and enable the Tasks app.
 
### Usage/Features

Once enabled, a new `Tasks` menu will appear in your owncloud apps menu. From there you can **add and delete tasks, edit their title, description,  start and due dates, reminder times, mark them as important, and add comments on them**. Tasks can be **shared** between users. Tasks can be **synchronized using CalDav** (each task list is linked to an Owncloud calendar, to sync it to your local client - Thunderbird, Evolution, KDE Kontact, iCal... - just add the calendar as a remote calendar in you client). You can **download your tasks as ICS** files using the download button for each calendar.
